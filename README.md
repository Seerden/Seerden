### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christiaan. I'm a full-time frontend dev working with React at the moment, and I have good experience with Vue as well. I also like to dabble in backend stuff for personal use, and am open to fullstack work too.

When it comes to programming in my spare time,
- I am currently working on a timekeeping/diary application (mostly for personal use) called [Track](https://github.com/seerden/track)
- I have some work-in-progress fullstack applications from a little while ago:
  - [Rack](https://github.com/seerden/rack): exercise (weightlifting-focussed for now) progress and gym session tracking (TypeScript - React, Node, PostgreSQL).
  - [Trade](https://github.com/seerden/trade): a charting/(simulated) trade review application akin to [Tradervue](https://www.tradervue.com/).
  - [Bits](https://github.com/seerden/Bits): a habit tracker, using React, TypeScript, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.
  - [Mana](https://github.com/seerden/mana): a spaced-repetition flashcard-based (language) learning application with React, TypeScript, Node, MongoDB and GraphQL.
