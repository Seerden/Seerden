### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christiaan. Working on my Master's degree in Astronomy (branching into Data Science). Currently looking to start working as a full-stack web developer.

At the moment, I'm working on a few projects for personal use and for portfolio purposes:
- [Bits](https://github.com/seerden/Bits): a habit tracker, using React, TypeScript, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.
- [Mana](https://github.com/seerden/mana): a spaced-repetition flashcard-based (language) learning application with React, TypeScript, Node, MongoDB and GraphQL.
