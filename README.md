### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christiaan. I work as a frontend web developer at Belsimpel, using a stack consisting of tech like React, TypeScript, Jest, styled-components.

When it comes to programming in my spare time, I focus on a few personal full-stack projects:
- [Trade](https://github.com/seerden/trade): a charting/(simulated) trade review application akin to [Tradervue](https://www.tradervue.com/).
- [Bits](https://github.com/seerden/Bits): a habit tracker, using React, TypeScript, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.
- [Mana](https://github.com/seerden/mana): a spaced-repetition flashcard-based (language) learning application with React, TypeScript, Node, MongoDB and GraphQL.
