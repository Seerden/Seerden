### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christiaan. Working on my Master's degree in Astronomy (branching into Data Science). Recently taken a much stronger interest in professionally pursuing development, so I recently started working full-time as a frontend web developer at Belsimpel.

In my spare time, to programming I focus on are a few projects for personal use and for portfolio purposes:
- [Bits](https://github.com/seerden/Bits): a habit tracker, using React, TypeScript, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.
- [Mana](https://github.com/seerden/mana): a spaced-repetition flashcard-based (language) learning application with React, TypeScript, Node, MongoDB and GraphQL.
- [Trade](https://github.com/seerden/trade): a charting/(simulated) trade review application akin to [Tradervue](https://www.tradervue.com/).
